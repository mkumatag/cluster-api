# Cluster API v1.0 compared to v1.1

This document provides an overview over relevant changes between ClusterAPI v1.0 and v1.1 for
maintainer of other providers and consumers of our Go API.

## Minimum Go version

* The Go version used by Cluster API is now Go 1.17+

## Dependencies

**Note**: Only the most relevant dependencies are listed, `k8s.io/` and `ginkgo`/`gomega` dependencies
are kept in sync with the versions used by `sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime`. 

- sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime: v0.10.x => v0.11.x
- sigs.k8s.io/controller-tools: v0.7.x => v0.8.x
- sigs.k8s.io/kind: v0.11.x => v0.11.x

## Changes by Kind

### Deprecation

* The Cluster and ClusterClass webhooks have been moved to the `webhooks` package. Thus, the following methods on `Cluster` and `ClusterClass` 
  in `api/v1beta1` are deprecated: `SetupWebhookWithManager`, `Default`, `ValidateCreate`, `ValidateUpdate` and `ValidateDelete`.
* The `third_party/kubernetes-drain` package is deprecated, as we're now using `k8s.io/kubectl/pkg/drain` instead ([PR](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api/pull/5440)). 
* `util/version.CompareWithBuildIdentifiers` has been deprecated, please use `util/version.Compare(a, b, WithBuildTags())` instead.

### API Change

* Some controllers have been moved to internal to reduce there API surface. We now only
  surface what is necessary, e.g. the reconciler and the `SetupWithManager` func:
    * [bootstrap/kubeadm](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api/pull/5493)
    * [test/infrastructure/docker/controllers](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api/pull/5595)
    * [exp/addons](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api/pull/5639)

### Other

* ClusterClass:
    * `clusterctl` is now able to handle cluster templates with ClusterClasses ([PR](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api/pull/5351)).
      Please check out the corresponding documentation in [clusterctl provider contract](https://cluster-api.sigs.k8s.io/clusterctl/provider-contract.html#clusterclass-definitions).
      If you have any further questions about writing ClusterClasses, please let us know.
    * e2e tests:
        * `QuickStartSpec` is now able to test clusters using ClusterClass. Please see this [PR](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api/pull/5423) for an example on how to use it.
        * `SelfHostedSpec` is now able to test clusters using ClusterClass. Please see this [PR](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api/pull/5600) for an example on how to use it.
* The `gci` linter has been enabled to enforce consistent imports. As usual, feel free to take a look at our linter config, but of course it's not mandatory to adopt it.
* The Tilt dev setup has been extended with:
    * [an option to deploy Grafana, Loki and promtail](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api/pull/5336) 
    * [options to ease debugging of controllers (delve, profiler, metrics)](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api/pull/5485)
